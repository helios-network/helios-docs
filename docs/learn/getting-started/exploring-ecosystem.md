# Exploring the Helios Ecosystem

The Helios ecosystem includes several essential components that allow users to participate in governance, stake assets, bridge tokens, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps). The [Helios Portal](https://portal.helioschain.network) serves as the main interface for managing activities on the network.

## Governance and Voting

Helios uses Interchain Proof of Stake and Reputation (I-PoSR) as its governance model. Governance decisions include:
- Voting on network upgrades and protocol changes.
- Adjusting staking parameters and reward distribution.
- Managing the onboarding and weight adjustments of assets within the consensus.

Governance operates through on-chain proposals, where users who have staked assets contribute to decision-making. The **Governance Dashboard** is accessible via the [Helios Portal](https://portal.helioschain.network) and provides insights into active and past proposals.

## Staking and Validator Participation

Unlike traditional staking mechanisms, users do not stake HELIOS tokens directly. Instead, they stake whitelisted assets that are part of the consensus mechanism. However, users can lock HELIOS tokens alongside their staked assets to receive an additional boost in APY rewards.

### How Staking Works
1. Users stake assets that are approved within the Helios consensus.
2. Validators secure the network by verifying these staked assets.
3. HELIOS tokens can be locked alongside staked assets to increase APY, but they can't be slashed.
4. The governance system can adjust the APY bonus for HELIOS locking over time.

### HELIOS Locking Mechanics
- The closer the locked HELIOS weight is to the weight of the staked asset, the higher the APY boost received.
- HELIOS locking is not mandatory but provides an incentive for long-term participation.
- Governance can adjust the APY boost rate for HELIOS locking dynamically.

All staking and delegation activities can be managed through the [Helios Portal](https://portal.helioschain.network).

## Bridging and Cross-Chain Transactions

Helios enables native cross-chain asset transfers without relying on traditional bridges. Key features include:
- Hyperion Modules that facilitate decentralized bridging.
- Automatic validation and reputation scoring for bridge operators.
- Secure asset transfers without wrapping mechanisms.

Users can move assets across different blockchains through the [Helios Portal](https://portal.helioschain.network), which provides a single interface for all cross-chain operations.

## dApps and Applications

Developers can build and deploy EVM-compatible dApps on Helios. The network supports:
- Smart contract execution across multiple chains.
- Automated interactions using AI and Hyperion Modules.
- Governance-based application integrations.

Users can explore and interact with Helios-based dApps through the [Helios Portal](https://portal.helioschain.network).

## Explorer and Monitoring Tools

To track transactions and network activity, Helios offers:
- **[Helios Explorer](https://explorer.helioschainlabs.org)** – A blockchain explorer for viewing transactions, blocks, and validator activity.
- **Staking Analytics** – A tool to monitor validator performance and rewards.
- **Governance Dashboard** – A view of active and past proposals, available within the [Helios Portal](https://portal.helioschain.network).

These tools provide real-time insights into network operations and governance decisions.

## Accessing the Helios Ecosystem

All interactions, from governance and staking to bridging and dApps, can be accessed through the [Helios Portal](https://portal.helioschain.network). The portal serves as the main interface for users and validators to manage their activities on the network.
