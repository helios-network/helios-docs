# Connecting to the Helios Network

To interact with Helios, you need to connect your wallet using **RPC settings**. Helios is **fully EVM-compatible**, so it works with any **Ethereum-based wallet** that allows custom networks.

## Network Details

| Network  | Chain ID | RPC URL | Block Explorer |
|----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Helios Testnet** | 4141 | https://dataseed-testnet.helioschain.network  | https://explorer-testnet.helioschain.network |
| **Helios Mainnet** | 4242 | https://dataseed.helioschain.network | https://explorer.helioschain.network |

*Testnet and mainnet details will be updated once live.*

## Adding Helios to Your Wallet

### **Using Metamask**
1. Open **Metamask** and go to **Settings > Networks**.
2. Click **Add a Network** and enter the Helios RPC details.
3. Save the settings and switch to the Helios network.

### **Using Rabby, Trust Wallet, or Other EVM Wallets**
- The process is similar to Metamask. Look for **"Add Custom Network"** in your wallet settings and input the Helios RPC details.

### **Using Cosmos Wallets (Keplr, Leap)**
Helios supports **Cosmos-compatible wallets**, but Cosmos interactions are optional.  
- In **Keplr or Leap**, navigate to **"Add Custom Chain"** and enter the RPC details.  
- Ensure that your Cosmos wallet supports EVM transactions if needed.

## Checking Connection
Once you've added the Helios network:
- Try sending a small transaction to verify connectivity.
- Check your wallet balance using the [Helios Explorer](TBD).

If you experience issues, refer to the **troubleshooting guide**.
