# XP & Leveling System

The XP system is the core mechanic of engagement on the Helios Testnet. It tracks meaningful activity across wallets and allows us to identify the most active, committed participants. This system feeds directly into your **level**, **tag progression**, and ultimately, your **airdrop eligibility**.

---

## What Is XP?

XP (Experience Points) represent your contribution to the Helios Testnet. Unlike a leaderboard-only system, XP has real impact:

- Determines your **level** and unlocks visibility on the **dashboard**
- Influences your **potential airdrop allocation**
- Qualifies you for **NFT badges**, **rewards**, and **early contributor roles**
- Interacts with **Tags** to multiply your XP gain

---

## How to Earn XP

XP is awarded for specific interactions across the testnet:

| Action | XP |
|--------|----|
| Completing onboarding | +1000 XP |
| Referring a new user (onboarding completed) | +1000 XP |
| Passive XP from your referrals’ actions | +5% of each referee's earned XP |
| Completing a daily quest | Variable |
| Staking, delegating, voting, or bridging | Variable |
| Reaching transaction thresholds | Automatically rewarded |

XP is awarded automatically and displayed in your dashboard in real time.

## Referral Rewards

Helios includes a referral-based multiplier to reward organic community growth.

When someone uses your referral code and finishes onboarding:
- You earn **+1000 XP** instantly
- You passively receive **5% of their XP earnings** for all future actions

There is no cap to the number of referrals you can make. Referrals are tracked permanently.

## Tags & XP Multipliers

Helios features a **tag-based identity system** that enhances XP progression.

Tags are awarded based on how you interact with the network, and each tag carries an **XP multiplier** applied to all future XP gains:

| Tag | XP Multiplier | How It’s Earned |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| `NONE` | 1.0x | Default |
| `DEPLOYER` | 1.5x | Deploying smart contracts |
| `FARMER` | 2.0x | Reaching transaction thresholds |
| `GUARDIAN` | 1.5x | Running a Hyperion node |
| `RESEARCHER` | 2.5x | Querying external chains |
| `LIQUIDITY_PROVIDER` | 2.0x | Providing real TVL on-chain |
| `PROPOSAL_MASTER` | 2.0x | Submitting or voting in proposals |
| `CONTRIBUTOR` | 4.0x | Buying early NFT badges (low tier) |
| `INVESTOR` | 6.0x | Buying early NFT badges (high tier) |
| `BUILDER` | 3.0x | Deploying verified apps (manual) |
| `MARKETER` | 3.5x | Key community referrals (manual) |
| `AMBASSADOR` | 2.5x | Core community roles (manual) |

> **Example**: If a quest normally gives 100 XP and you have the `RESEARCHER` tag, you'll earn 250 XP instead.

Tags are visible from your dashboard and are applied automatically or manually depending on the criteria.

## Leveling System

Your XP contributes directly to your **level**, which represents your activity on the testnet.

Level progression is linear at first and scales as you gain more XP. Leveling up:
- Unlocks access to exclusive quests or features
- May qualify you for gated badges
- Impacts airdrop tiering

There is no upper limit—XP and leveling continue indefinitely during the testnet.
