# Exploring the Dashboard

The Helios Testnet dashboard is your mission control center. It provides full visibility into your XP progression, active quests, tags, badges, and referral performance. From this single interface, you can track your growth, engage with the testnet, and maximize your eligibility for future rewards and recognition.

## What You’ll See on the Dashboard

Once you complete onboarding, your personalized dashboard becomes active. Here’s what’s available:

### XP & Level Progress

Your total earned XP is displayed prominently, along with your current **level**. As you interact with the network and complete quests, this number updates in real time.

- Levels increase linearly at first, then scale with higher XP milestones
- XP progress bar shows how close you are to your next level
- Leveling up may unlock badges or exclusive tasks

---

### Daily Quest Tracker

Every 24 hours, new quests are generated. The dashboard lets you:
- View the **current quest list**
- Track which quests you've already completed
- See your **+50% XP bonuses** for each completed quest
- Monitor whether you're eligible for the **3,000 XP all-quests-completed bonus**

---

### Tags & XP Multipliers

If you've earned any tags based on your network activity (e.g., `RESEARCHER`, `FARMER`, `DEPLOYER`), they’ll appear on your profile.

- Tags apply permanent XP multipliers to all future activity
- Tags are earned automatically or manually depending on your behavior
- Multiple tags can stack, boosting your XP output significantly

---

### Badges

Any badges you’ve earned are displayed in your profile panel. Badges may:
- Be tied to achievements, contributions, or events
- Influence your long-term visibility and recognition
- Become **mintable NFTs** in future stages of the testnet

Badge rarities and types are also viewable, and new badges will appear here as they’re unlocked.

---

### Referral Code & Stats

You’ll find your **referral code** directly on the dashboard.

- Share it with others to earn **+1000 XP per user** who finishes onboarding
- Earn **+5% of all XP** generated by each referred user
- View your total referral count and accumulated XP from your network

---

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard showcases top contributors based on total XP earned.

- Updated dynamically as users earn XP
- Encourages healthy competition and public recognition
- May influence airdrop tiering or contributor roles
