# Getting Started with the Helios Testnet

This guide will walk you through the first steps required to begin testing and earning XP on the Helios Testnet. You'll connect your wallet, complete onboarding with our AI assistant, claim faucet tokens, and unlock your access to the XP farming system.

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

To begin, visit [testnet.helioschain.network](https://testnet.helioschain.network) and connect your Web3 wallet.

Helios supports **any EVM-compatible wallet**, including:
- **MetaMask**
- **Rabby Wallet**
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- And others

Once connected, the system will prompt you to sign a verification message. This confirms wallet ownership and prepares your account for on-chain interactions.

## Step 2: Meet Phaëton

After connecting your wallet, you'll be introduced to **Phaëton**, the Helios AI assistant. Phaëton will guide you through the onboarding flow, ensuring you're ready to start participating.

Phaëton will:
- Explain the basics of the testnet
- Provide you with your referral code
- Direct you to the faucet system
- Introduce the XP dashboard and your progression path

## Step 3: Claim Faucet Tokens (During Onboarding)

As part of the onboarding guided by **Phaëton**, you’ll be prompted to claim your first batch of testnet $HELIOS tokens. This is a required step to enable on-chain interactions like staking, voting, and participating in quests.

During onboarding:
- Phaëton will guide you to the faucet and ask you to click “Claim”
- Your wallet will receive free testnet tokens
- This action is tracked to enforce the **24-hour cooldown per wallet**

The faucet system ensures each participant receives enough tokens to begin testing, while backend logic prevents abuse through duplicate claims or Sybil attempts.

## Step 4: Begin Earning XP

Once you’re funded, you can begin exploring all parts of the testnet. XP is earned by performing meaningful actions, including:
- Submitting governance votes
- Bridging assets
- Delegating tokens
- Referring other users
- Completing daily quests

Your XP progress is tracked in real time from your personal dashboard.

## Step 5: Share and Refer

As part of the XP system, you can generate your **referral code** and invite others to join the testnet. When someone completes onboarding using your code:
- You receive +1000 XP
- You also earn 5% of all XP they earn permanently

Referral growth is not just rewarded—it’s measured as a sign of early contribution.
