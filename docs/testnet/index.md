# Welcome to the Helios Testnet

The Helios Testnet is a production-grade testing environment designed to evaluate the performance, reliability, and interoperability of the Helios blockchain before mainnet launch. It enables developers, validators, and ecosystem contributors to simulate real-world scenarios, validate cross-chain functionality, and actively participate in shaping the future of Helios.

Whether you're testing modules, analyzing transaction flow, or engaging in interchain governance, the testnet offers a robust and rewarding framework to explore the full capabilities of the Helios infrastructure.

## Key Objectives

- **Validate the stability and performance** of Helios under real usage conditions  
- **Test interoperability** with external chains using Hyperion modules  
- **Experiment with on-chain features** such as staking, delegation, and governance  
- **Deploy smart contracts and dApps** in an EVM-compatible test environment  
- **Analyze validator behavior** in the I-PoSR consensus model  

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/AjpJnJxt5e) to follow real-time updates as community members complete missions and level up.
A live activity feed lets you track achievements, quest completions, and XP milestones across the network.

## Integrated Engagement Layer

One of the key incentives for participating in the Helios Testnet is eligibility for the future Helios airdrop. XP is more than a score—it’s a metric of contribution, effort, and engagement. The higher your XP and level, the greater your potential allocation of mainnet tokens.

To ensure fairness and integrity, Helios implements robust Sybil protection mechanisms. These safeguards ensure that only genuine, active participants—not bots or duplicate accounts—can benefit from the airdrop and recognition systems.

The testnet introduces a gamified experience to encourage deeper participation:

- **Onboarding via Phaëton**, the Helios AI mascot assistant that guides first-time users  
- **Faucet system** for claiming testnet $HELIOS tokens  
- **XP system** to track contributions and test engagement across wallets  
- **Tags and multipliers** that reward active validators, builders, researchers, and more  

This system provides both telemetry for the protocol and recognition for participants.

## Who Should Participate?

- Protocol engineers and smart contract developers  
- Validator operators testing node infrastructure  
- Security auditors and bug bounty hunters  
- Researchers validating cross-chain mechanics  
- Community contributors preparing for launch  

## Requirements

- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) - EVM compatible wallets
- Access to [testnet.helioschain.network](https://testnet.helioschain.network) and [portal.helioschain.network](https://portal.helioschain.network)
- Interest in contributing to a scalable, interchain blockchain
