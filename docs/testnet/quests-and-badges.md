# Quests & Badges

The Helios Testnet incorporates daily quests and collectible badges to incentivize consistent contribution and recognize key achievements. These systems encourage users to explore all areas of the ecosystem, while providing permanent on-chain and off-chain proof of participation.

## Daily Quests

Each day, the backend generates a new set of randomized quests based on live network activity. Quests reward you with XP and may contribute toward badge unlocks or tag upgrades.

### How Daily Quests Work

- A new quest set is generated **every 24 hours**
- Quests are based on testnet actions such as:
  - Voting on proposals
  - Delegating tokens
  - Interacting with smart contracts
  - Querying external chains (via Hyperion)
- Each quest has its own **base XP reward**
- Completing a daily quest gives you **+50% bonus XP** on top of the base reward
- Completing **all daily quests** grants an additional **+3,000 XP bonus**
- Progress is tracked in real time from your dashboard

### Example Quest Types

| Quest | Description | Base Reward | Final Reward (with +50%) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Stake HELIOS | Delegate testnet tokens to a validator | 250 XP | 375 XP |
| Vote on a proposal | Submit an on-chain governance vote | 300 XP | 450 XP |
| Perform a bridge transaction | Use the cross-chain module | 400 XP | 600 XP |
| Reach 5 transactions in 24h | Hit activity threshold | 150 XP | 225 XP |

If you complete all quests for the day, an **additional 3,000 XP** is automatically awarded, and you may receive a shout-out on the Helios Discord.

## Achievements & Milestones

Beyond daily activity, users can unlock **one-time achievements** tied to larger milestones.

| Achievement | Trigger | Type |
|-------------|---------|------|
| First Onboarding | Complete the initial testnet flow | Milestone |
| First Referral | Onboard a new user via your code | Contribution |
| Tag Acquired | Earn any tag through behavior | System |
| Validator Role | Operate a live Hyperion node | Contribution |
| Smart Contract Deployment | Publish a contract to the testnet | Builder |

These are often paired with badge unlocks and may also influence your eligibility for exclusive rewards.

## Badge System

Badges are collectible assets that signify testnet accomplishments. Each badge is categorized by **type** and **rarity**, and may carry XP bonuses or symbolic value within the ecosystem.

### Badge Types

- **Achievement** – Tied to specific actions or milestones  
- **Contribution** – Community or development involvement  
- **Special Event** – Seasonal or campaign-based badges  
- **Milestone** – Tied to XP or level progression  

### Badge Rarity

- `Common`  
- `Rare`  
- `Epic`  
- `Legendary`

Higher rarity badges may require manual validation or participation in limited-time events.

## Where to View Your Badges

Once unlocked, badges appear in your dashboard profile. Some may also be **mintable as NFTs** later in the testnet lifecycle, depending on participation and verification.
