# Frequently Asked Questions

This page covers common questions related to the Helios Testnet, XP system, referrals, rewards, and technical behavior. If you don‚Äôt find your answer here, feel free to ask in the Helios Discord community.

---

## General

### ‚ùì What is the purpose of the Helios Testnet?

The testnet is designed to simulate real usage of the Helios blockchain before mainnet launch. It allows developers, validators, and contributors to test features, identify bugs, and help shape the protocol.

### üéØ Is this testnet permanent?

No. The testnet is an evolving environment that may be reset periodically. However, your XP, referral history, and badges may be preserved for airdrop eligibility snapshots or future testnet phases.

---

## XP & Progression

### What is XP used for?

XP tracks your participation and contribution. It affects:
- Your testnet level
- Eligibility for the Helios airdrop
- Access to badges, quests, and community roles
- Leaderboard ranking

### How is XP calculated?

XP is awarded for actions like onboarding, staking, bridging, governance voting, referrals, and completing quests. XP is then modified based on:
- Your active tags (XP multipliers)
- Whether an action was part of a daily quest (+50% bonus)
- Whether you were referred by someone (extra 10%)
- Whether you completed all daily quests (+3,000 XP bonus)

### Does leveling up give extra rewards?

Leveling up increases your visibility and may unlock badge tiers or exclusive features. In future phases, it may also influence reward distributions and recognition systems.

---

## Referrals

### How does the referral system work?

Each wallet gets a unique referral code after onboarding. When someone uses your code:
- You earn **+1000 XP** once they complete onboarding
- You passively receive **5% of all XP** they earn, forever

### Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?

No limit. The more people you onboard, the more XP you can earn.

---

## Tags & Badges

### What are tags?

Tags are identity markers tied to your behavior on the testnet. They provide **XP multipliers** and recognize contributions such as:
- Running a node (`GUARDIAN`)
- Making cross-chain queries (`RESEARCHER`)
- Providing liquidity (`LIQUIDITY_PROVIDER`)
- Referring new users (`MARKETER`)
- Contributing early (`CONTRIBUTOR`, `INVESTOR`)

### Are badges NFTs?

Not yet, but many badges may be mintable as NFTs later in the testnet lifecycle, depending on participation and eligibility.

---

## Airdrop & Rewards

### Will there be a Helios airdrop?

Yes. The XP and level you accumulate on the testnet will be used as one of the **key factors** for determining your eligibility and allocation in the Helios airdrop.

### How do you prevent bots or sybil attacks?

We implement multiple Sybil protection mechanisms including:
- Onboarding wallet validation
- Faucet cooldown enforcement
- Behavior-based scoring
- Backend checks to flag artificial farming

Only real, consistent participation is rewarded.

---

## Technical & Troubleshooting

### I didn‚Äôt receive faucet tokens. What should I do?

Make sure you‚Äôre connected to the correct wallet and network. You can only claim tokens **once every 24 hours**. If the problem persists, contact the team through Discord.

### I completed a task but didn‚Äôt get XP. Why?

XP is only awarded if:
- The task was valid (not duplicated)
- You met the conditions (e.g., part of the current daily quests)
- Your wallet is not blocked by cooldown or Sybil checks

If needed, raise the issue via support channels.
