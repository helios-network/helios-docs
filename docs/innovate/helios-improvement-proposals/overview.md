# Overview

A **Helios Improvement Proposal (HIP)** is an official document describing a new feature, process, or improvement for the Helios network. It clearly outlines the rationale, specifications, and potential impacts, allowing community discussion and structured decision-making.

## HIP Lifecycle

The typical lifecycle of a HIP includes:

1. Idea submission (via an issue)
2. Community review and discussion
3. Drafting and refining the proposal (HD)
4. Formal submission and peer review
5. Approval and implementation
